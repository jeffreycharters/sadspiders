  <h3 id="summers-almost-over">SUMMER&rsquo;S ALMOST OVER!!!</h3>
<p>As August draws to a close, let&rsquo;s all take a moment to remind it that we all hate it and it&rsquo;s a shitty month and it can fuck off. And take February with it.</p>
<h3 id="set-your-goals">Set Your Goals</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, August is almost over and I haven&rsquo;t got out mountain biking nearly as much as I would have liked, but that&rsquo;s okay. A lot of life has been happening, and we deal with it a day at a time.</p>
<p>This spring, you will recall that I finally accomplished my goal of <a href="../the-windiest-135km-bike-ride/">doing the 100km+ ride</a> from our home to my gfs family&rsquo;s farm for Easter. This was my first ride to cross the 100km mark and the conditions were sub-optimal. The windiest day of the year so far as a crosswind definitely didn&rsquo;t make that ride any easier and I was not in the greatest spirits as we crossed the finish line.</p>
<p>So the obvious thing to do is to create a new, more ambitious goal. So here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myself and my bicycle, Grimey, will hereby attempt to complete an &ldquo;imperial century&rdquo; ride of 100 miles or more by the end of October of this year. We begin at Buckingham Palace and the Queen herself will drop the green flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I will be renaming our house Buckingham Palace for the occasion and Ashley will be happy to accept the Queen monicker until the mutinies start.</p>
<h3 id="that-sounds-awful">That sounds awful</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because we all keep up with our own version of the Joneses. My youtube feed is full of 150 or more mile ultra-endurance races, so doing a ride like this seems quite tame in comparison. But I mention it to normies (aka friends and family) and they are quick to point out that how do you do that it&rsquo;s so far? Same way as you eat an elephant I suppose.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-plan">Making a plan</h3>
<p>So this ride will be in less than two months, and possibly within a month or so. Which does not leave a heap of time for training and conditioning. Shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll create a more formal plan for myself, but in the meantime, how to prepare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend more time on the bike. Just in general. Get the body used to it.</li>
<li>Hill training. Head out for less than an hour and repeatedly ride up the biggest hills in the area at full gas, recover on the way back down. It&rsquo;s high-intensity intervals and it sucks but it will build some strength and should hopefully provide quick/substantial cardiovascular gains.</li>
<li>Longer, mellow rides. Head out to the rail trails and just cruise for two hours or more. Sometimes go for a second ride that day, make sure the body is okay with having to go when it doesn&rsquo;t really want to.</li>
<li>Eat and ride. When you&rsquo;re out for extended rides and want to make good time, you need to train your body to expend energy and digest at the same time. So bring a substantial snack to eat at the start of the ride, or even at the halfway point.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the last ride, my guts felt gross in the second half from eating the [high-calories == crap] food, so I might need to experiment with this a bit more.</p>
<h3 id="stay-tuned">Stay tuned</h3>
<p>The last ride clocked in around 135km and lasted about seven hours, I think? So planning to tack on another hour, which hopefully won&rsquo;t destroy me.</p>
<p>If anyone want to loan me a drone and wants to come out for a small section to get some aerial shots, that&rsquo;d be awesome. No pay!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted as we move towards R-day.</p>
