<p>Remember a bunch of years ago when Facebook was just some stupid website some of your friends used? When webrings were a (terrible) thing? Nerds like to call that period of time Web 1.0, back when the internet was full of potential and not completely ruined by sex predators and advertising, but just by sex predators.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing here. Just some profanity-laced opinions about lanterns. Self-aggrandizing posts about how I am right about everything. What are you going to do, argue against me? Where? I don&rsquo;t have comments and therefore am always speaking the loudest.</p>
<p>However I also really want to create a friends link up along the top there. So if you have some time and want to hack out some blog posts at some point, get in touch and I&rsquo;ll help you get set up. ðŸ¥º please, for me?</p>
<p>Alright enough horse crap for right now. Go read some of my blogs please, then go <a href="https://letsblurt.duckdns.org">blurt</a>.</p>
