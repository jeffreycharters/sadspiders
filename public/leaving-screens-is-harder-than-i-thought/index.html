  <h3 id="my-phone-is-my-life">&ldquo;My phone is my life&rdquo;</h3>
<p>I came across a post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> about <a href="https://vaidik.bearblog.dev/feeling-uncomfortable-when-leaving-phone-at-home-shouldnt-be-normal/">feeling uncomfortable leaving your phone at home</a>. There are good reasons to bring a cell phone with you when going about daily life, such as emergencies and not getting bored while using the lavatory. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you ever need to <em>use</em> it, or even ever have it breathe fresh air.</p>
<p>I was sitting at the kitchen table yesterday evening when a <a href="https://letsblurt.duckdns.org">Blurt</a> popped into my head and demanded to be written down. It said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My phone is my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, if this were Blurt the whole thing would have been truncated to &ldquo;My phone is my&rdquo; and so that&rsquo;s why Blurt is stupid sometimes.</p>
<p>But I sat there and stared at it for a minute or two. Pensively.</p>
<h3 id="the-attention-whores-are-really-good-at-it">The Attention-whores are really good at it.</h3>
<p>The last few days I&rsquo;ve made an effort to not use my phone as much. Or any screens (with the caveat that my current occupation is listed as &ldquo;web developer&rdquo; or some such shit and so I need to use a computer for work). Let me re-phrase that to fit in with the cultural zeitgeist: I am trying to become more <em>mindful</em> of my interactions with digital medias.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s harder than I thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a combination of habit and whatever sordid psychology is used to keep people hooked, but it works. For the last few days, I&rsquo;ve had this weird feeling of missing something. I want to say &ldquo;not in a fear-of-missing-out way, but maybe that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. It&rsquo;s taking a fair amount of will-power and planning to stick to it.</p>
<h3 id="conversely">Conversely</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also felt more productive, because it&rsquo;s nice outside and I&rsquo;m not just spending my time looking at pictures of pro mountain bikers on Instantgram or whatever the hell else I end up doing on that thing. Even just a few minutes here and there where I have my head up and in the real world have been nicer, somehow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real end-game here. I just like judging people who are walking around on their phones with their faces buried in their screens like assholes. Despite the fact that I generally don&rsquo;t walk around with my phone (like an asshole), I am no better than them. And I <em>must</em> be <em>better</em> than <em>them.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-news-oh-man">The NEWS, oh man</h3>
<p>The other thing that chewed through a lot of time and unnecessary mental energy is the news. I haven&rsquo;t given up on the news completely, I have allowed myself to read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> because it&rsquo;s decently curated and only the bigger stories really ever filter through. Mostly it&rsquo;s a bunch of nerdy headlines that I don&rsquo;t actually understand, but when I say them at parties people nod along and look impressed. Oh and we watch Colbert&rsquo;s monolog after dins regularly, so we get some real-hard-left news.</p>
<p>Reading the news daily was a huge waste, for me personally. I don&rsquo;t care if anyone else wants to read the news, it&rsquo;s a free country. But it was like Faishbook, once I stopped using it I really didn&rsquo;t miss anything there. I&rsquo;m not even an anti-media nutjob, there&rsquo;s just about 95% of things that happen every day will not affect me. So why expend the intellectual energy to learn about them or whatever emotional or psychological energy to empathize or what-have-you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what has happened since I quit reading the news:</p>
<ul>
<li>The climate continues to go to shit.</li>
<li>American law/politics continues to be <em>real</em> stupid.</li>
<li>Vladdy Putin is doing some real awful stuff, poorly.</li>
<li>Johnny Depp and some lady are in court and it&rsquo;s stupid.</li>
</ul>
<p>There. You&rsquo;re up-to-date. Call me cynical, you&rsquo;re probably not far off.</p>
<h3 id="its-summer">It&rsquo;s summer!</h3>
<p>Which brings me to the whole purpose of all of this.</p>
<p>Computers were supposed to make life better and they incredibly, totally have. However, they weren&rsquo;t supposed to simultaneously turn us into mindless numbnutses who argue about everything and have really strong opinions about whatever the topic-du-jour is. They were supposed to provide us with more leisure time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ride some bikes, hike some trails, pet some dogs, eat some veggie burgers. Plant some trees, eat some veggies and hummus and ride some more bikes. And then let&rsquo;s hang out and talk about it without worrying about pictures to show off how good things are. Let&rsquo;s just enjoy things as they happen.</p>
