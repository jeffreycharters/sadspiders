<content>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, there&rsquo;s a good chance you are learning to code to try to get a job, attract a mate and live happily ever after. Good for you, what a noble pursuit.</p>
<p>This is going to be a bit of a breakdown of how I got from being someone with some basic HTML and CSS knowledge to the hack that I am today, with a superficial knowledge of a hundred other technologies. Strap in.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-the-why-of-it-all">Introduction: The <em>why</em> of it all.</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do things &ldquo;just because&rdquo;. Ha ha yeah I totally do but maybe not this time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into the story in about 2016 or thereabouts. I had myself a Raspberry Pi model 3B+ and was teaching myself the basics of Linux. I kept coming across people talking about writing scripts in Python, so I decide to try doing that. I stumbled across the website <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> because I hate boring stuff and spent some time going through that publication from cover to cover. Neat, I can program stuff now! I tried writing a program to automate some of the boring bullshit for my day job and.. ..it doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>At work we run Windows computers without Python installed, so I need to strap an entire Python interpreter into an <em>exe</em> file and the whole thing just sort of reeks of hackiness. I am not impressed. So I abandon that ship and just keep doing the boring shit the old fashioned way.</p>
<h3 id="the-webserver">The Webserver</h3>
<p>My first attempt at doing programming stuff has taught me that I need to learn more about how the web works. I start working on a website to crowdsource mountain bike trail conditions using Python and the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask framework</a> using a great tutorial by <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Miguel Grinberg</a>. It went well, and I learned more about relational databases (MySQL in this case) and reverse proxies (nginx) and hosted the whole thing on the Raspberry pi. It&rsquo;s sweet! But no one really uses it and in retrospect it could have been done a lot better but that&rsquo;s also a good thing - I&rsquo;ve learned a lot since then!</p>
<h3 id="the-pandemic">The Pandemic</h3>
<p>My website was sort of crappy and no one used it and I was working full time in an analytical chemistry laboratory and didn&rsquo;t really know where this whole thing was headed.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic hit and the world lost it&rsquo;s collective shit, and fair enough.</p>
<p>I took advantage of this time to create some Python-based scripts to do some web scraping of some work-related websites that never really went anywhere. I was still working in the lab a few days a week because my job was <em>essential</em> but with my extra time I came across the <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">Full Stack Open</a> course through the University of Helsinki. Was I ready to learn <em>React</em>? Isn&rsquo;t React for smart people? What the fuck is it, anyway?</p>
<p>I spent a few week and went through the entire course, diligently completing all of the examples and assignments. Look at me, using javascript like a champ to make a webpage that is <em>reactive</em>. Being able to launch apps on Netlify was a game-changer for me, I could finally implement a bunch of these websites for my day job to process my instrument data and save myself multiple minutes a day! React rules! Except I don&rsquo;t really like using Redux and there&rsquo;s something about it that rubs me the wrong way.</p>
<p>Also I learned Git at this point. Fuck yeah!</p>
<h3 id="enter-svelte">Enter Svelte</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t rememeber how I stumbed across <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, but it seemed like a next-gen version of React where all the hacky shit had been replaced with native support. I set up an app using their website builder called Sapper. It seemed okay, but I was still lost with respect to web development. There&rsquo;s literally a trillion technologies out there. What&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a> like?</p>
<h3 id="enter-go">Enter Go</h3>
<p>For some reason I thought that maybe I was a back-end guy. The internet fucking sucks sometimes, you know? I don&rsquo;t want to serve ads or collect user data or any of this shit. Maybe writing backend code will give me some sort of bigger purpose, maybe I can crunch data that climate scientists use to make the world actually better. This is a theme I struggle with constantly. Very existential but ultimately unanswerable.</p>
<p>I read some sort of introductory book on Go from cover to cover and performed and the exercises. Woo, Go! The best part is using the walrus-operator to assign variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#ebdbb2;background-color:#282828;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span>number <span style="color:#fe8019">:=</span> <span style="color:#d3869b">42</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>See? Walrus! I&rsquo;m also fully aware of the difference between a dynamically-typed language and a statically-type language. Neat! I like that while I&rsquo;m writing Go in VSCode that I&rsquo;ve got code autocomplation thanks to the strongly-typed variables, even though there are still a few concepts that elude me (looking at you, <em>interfaces</em>).</p>
<p>Okay, great, now I&rsquo;m a backend guy a little bit.</p>
<h3 id="backend-is-stupid">Backend is stupid</h3>
<p>I quickly have nothing to program on the backend and Go is a bit scary, what with concurrency and pointers and whatnot. Furthermore, <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">Sveltekit</a> is a thing now! Neat! I program another couple of little projects using Sveltekit. Holy shit, React is so shitty compared to Sveltekit! I make the decision that I would rather compete for the scarce few Sveltekit jobs rather than ever have to touch React again. I am firmly a Sveltekit guy and as much of a Rich Harris fanboy as you can be at middle-age. Sveltekit is also basically it&rsquo;s own server, so we can just do everything in javascript!</p>
<h3 id="learn-all-of-the-things">Learn all of the things</h3>
<p>So now what? At this point I&rsquo;ve dabbled in literally a fuckton of different languages and frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, SASS, LESS</li>
<li>Node, Express, Svelte, Sveltekit, React, Redux, Flask</li>
<li>Bootstrap, Foundation,Tailwind</li>
<li>Javascript, Python, Go</li>
<li>Apache, nginx</li>
<li>MySQL, sqlite, MongoDB, Mongoose, Prisma</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are others that I tried for an hour or two and dismissed, but these are all at least things I have basic proficiency with. My favourite stack has become a sqlite database with sveltekit frontend and prisma acting as the go-between.</p>
<h4 id="interlude-my-day-job-it-department-hates-me-until-they-dont">Interlude: My Day-job It Department Hates me. Until they don&rsquo;t.</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working full-time in the lab throughout this whole process, and have offered to moonlight in the IT department and also have learned a ton of SQL in an effort to become the new database administrator to no avail. Boo. Annoyed.</p>
<p>However, a friend that works in the department vouched for me as a reasonably-competent developer, and I get a one-year contract to develop an in-house e-commerce-type site. Woohoo, coding for a living, suck it everyone!</p>
<p>The project ends up being a success, I am able to ship the projects thanks to the batteries-included <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> project. In the end I think the whole thing is a bit hacky, but it has been used in production for nine months at the time I am writing this with no major crap-ups so I&rsquo;m calling that a win! This was a nice little opportunity that I am happy to have on my resume. Networking ftw! Except I still hate LinkedIn and pretty sure I always will. But if you like it and it works for you, power to you.</p>
<h3 id="typescript-btw">Typescript, btw</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;m getting deep into the workings of Sveltekit, I am noticing that for some reason they are all about Typescript. I assume, naturally, that I am too stupid to understand Typescript but decide to have a go at it. I dabbled a bit during the Full Stack Open course and was definitely less-than-impressed.</p>
<p>So I read the entire <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/">Programming Tpyescript</a> book and skimmed the parts that were over my head.</p>
<p>I spun up a new Sveltekit project to much around with. It&rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve for sure and I spend a fair amount of time going through the Sveltekit docs to figure out what sort of types need to be assigned to some default variables, but nothing too crazy.</p>
<p>And it turns out, Typescript is fucking awesome. I had heard that it was too much overhead for small projects, but the amount of time I was saving thanks to my IDE&rsquo;s autocompletion is super-great. Getting screwed by inappropriate return types in my functions screwed me a couple of times during my Django project, so I appreciate knowing exactly what each variable looks like and what sort of parameters it might have available instead of <code>console.log</code>ging things until they work. I still do that, but just less now.</p>
<h3 id="going-for-the-win">Going for the win</h3>
<p>At this point I am back in the lab and want to find a full-time remote gig. I&rsquo;ve got my stack of choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sveltekit + Typescript</li>
<li>PostgreSQL database</li>
<li><a href="https://prisma.io">Prisma</a> ORM</li>
<li>Maybe some Go because I still like Go even though it&rsquo;s not Rust btw</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to be able to tell prospective employers that I&rsquo;ve got collaborative experience using Git, I create the <a href="https://github.com/jeffreycharters/station">STaTioN</a> repository. It consists of the very basic building blocks of a modern website:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.html</code></li>
<li><code>style.css</code></li>
<li><code>script.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I initiate those files with a very basic amount of data and ask some of my Twitter friends to get involved if they so choose. They do! It&rsquo;s kind of awesome learning how to deal with Pull Requests and issues and all that type of stuff with no real &ldquo;Prod&rdquo; to break, and if you do no one really cares because it&rsquo;s all just there to break anyway. Thanks for getting involved, everyone! I&rsquo;ve let the site stagnate, I sometimes think about torching it all back down to the very basics and starting over. We&rsquo;ll see, maybe?</p>
<h3 id="finally-a-job">Finally a job</h3>
<p>I applied to many, many places. However, I was also deliberate with my applications. I don&rsquo;t believe in the &ldquo;spray &rsquo;n&rsquo; pray&rdquo; school of thought. My cover letters were all tailored to the individual position. I got a couple of interviews, which was promising, and also a lot of radio-silence, which was not. So I just kept applying. I found jobs via the usual job sites, I looked for local developers and contacted them directly.</p>
<p>My break into the field came from a job ad on the Svelte Discord server&rsquo;s job section. Sveltekit had reached the <strong>Verion 1.0</strong> milestone which means &ldquo;yeah use this in production now, I don&rsquo;t give a shit&rdquo; which I think gave more employers the confidence to deploy their Sveltekit projects. The company promised resume-free hiring, which is super awesome because resumes are stupid and no one really knows if they&rsquo;re doing them right and the whole thing can just use an overhaul.</p>
<p>So I went through their process, did an online interview, and they got in touch a week or so later with a job offer! Woooo work-from-home FTW!</p>
<p>ᄽ(ノ◕⌢◕)ᄽノ ︵ ┻━┻</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The new employer&rsquo;s backend is written in Go and is actually a GraphQL server. So I actually get to write Go professionally! Nice.</p>
<h3 id="postamble">Postamble</h3>
<p><img src="computer-guy.jpg" alt="The fat nerdy computer guy from South Park and he&rsquo;s got some mountain dew"></p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it. I spent a number of years during my evenings and weekends teaching myself to write code and now I have a job where I sit at home all day and write code. I&rsquo;m not going to get fat though since I enjoy endurance cycling and regular mountain biking and rock climbing and all sort of other shit.</p>
<h3 id="my-advice">My Advice</h3>
<p>Did you read this fucking thing? You don&rsquo;t want my advice.</p>
<p>But if you insist, pick some shit you like and start writing code. Keep up to date with things, the field changes every 3 or 4 days and you need to learn a new language or framework or some other shit. Give up and become an electrician or plumber or something. But I guess in the end I&rsquo;m proof that you can get started on a career as a programmer for basically no monies as long as you have unlimited time to spend learning all this shit.</p>
<p>I do like it though, really.</p>
