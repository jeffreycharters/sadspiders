      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-a-book-stupid&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a book, stupid.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw on &lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt; that someone was reading the book &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; by Panos Louridas and someone else commented that it was a good read. So, being the good nerd that I am, I raced out and got myself a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t read too much yet, maybe two or three chapters. Enough to cover the majority of Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm. And it made me realize something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just effing &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; living in the &amp;ldquo;valley of despair&amp;rdquo; in a Dunning-Kruger knowledge/perceived-knowledge figure. For some reason I am fascinated by how much smarter other people are than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1337c0d3-v-me&#34;&gt;1337c0d3 v. me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where my future career is going to go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a ton in order to do web development effectively. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve needed to learn to get here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;python and then Flask and Django, the web frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;javascript, and then React and Sveltekit, the web frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML and CSS so I can make websites that don&amp;rsquo;t look like a dog&amp;rsquo;s breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL and relational databases, so I can store data effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nodejs and Express to be able to program a webserver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use version control software and collaborate with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to set up an nginx reverse proxy and load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I still have that sinking feeling of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wtf am I doing here? I like the internet, but 99.8% of it is porno or advertising or marketing or social mediae and I don&amp;rsquo;t want any part of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-algorithms&#34;&gt;Enter algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are generally pretty good. I spent a year doing web dev work for my current employer. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://station-team.netlify.app&#34;&gt;little open-source project&lt;/a&gt; had some traction and was good to introduce people to making Github pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel like I want to get deeper. To go behing the scenes. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know doing what. To crunch data, to make things run more efficiently. And algorithms seem to be a crucial step in that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;ll see where this goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as mentioned earlier, it seems like I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the bottom of a huge mountain, looking up and being baffled that I might even take a few footsteps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But moving forward is what we must do. Otherwise I get bored and overwhelmed by the shitty state of society/planet, so a distraction is a requirement. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a small amount of graph theory and how to find the shortest path between two points using a non-greedy algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned. Hopefully things get nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leaving screens is harder than I thought</title>
      <link>https://sadspiders.ca/leaving-screens-is-harder-than-i-thought/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 19:56:43 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-phone-is-my-life&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My phone is my life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;https://vaidik.bearblog.dev/feeling-uncomfortable-when-leaving-phone-at-home-shouldnt-be-normal/&#34;&gt;feeling uncomfortable leaving your phone at home&lt;/a&gt;. There are good reasons to bring a cell phone with you when going about daily life, such as emergencies and not getting bored while using the lavatory. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean you ever need to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, or even ever have it breathe fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at the kitchen table yesterday evening when a &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsblurt.duckdns.org&#34;&gt;Blurt&lt;/a&gt; popped into my head and demanded to be written down. It said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone is my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if this were Blurt the whole thing would have been truncated to &amp;ldquo;My phone is my&amp;rdquo; and so that&amp;rsquo;s why Blurt is stupid sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I sat there and stared at it for a minute or two. Pensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-attention-whores-are-really-good-at-it&#34;&gt;The Attention-whores are really good at it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve made an effort to not use my phone as much. Or any screens (with the caveat that my current occupation is listed as &amp;ldquo;web developer&amp;rdquo; or some such shit and so I need to use a computer for work). Let me re-phrase that to fit in with the cultural zeitgeist: I am trying to become more &lt;em&gt;mindful&lt;/em&gt; of my interactions with digital medias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s harder than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably a combination of habit and whatever sordid psychology is used to keep people hooked, but it works. For the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve had this weird feeling of missing something. I want to say &amp;ldquo;not in a fear-of-missing-out way, but maybe that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it is. It&amp;rsquo;s taking a fair amount of will-power and planning to stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conversely&#34;&gt;Conversely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also felt more productive, because it&amp;rsquo;s nice outside and I&amp;rsquo;m not just spending my time looking at pictures of pro mountain bikers on Instantgram or whatever the hell else I end up doing on that thing. Even just a few minutes here and there where I have my head up and in the real world have been nicer, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no real end-game here. I just like judging people who are walking around on their phones with their faces buried in their screens like assholes. Despite the fact that I generally don&amp;rsquo;t walk around with my phone (like an asshole), I am no better than them. And I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-news-oh-man&#34;&gt;The NEWS, oh man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that chewed through a lot of time and unnecessary mental energy is the news. I haven&amp;rsquo;t given up on the news completely, I have allowed myself to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s decently curated and only the bigger stories really ever filter through. Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of nerdy headlines that I don&amp;rsquo;t actually understand, but when I say them at parties people nod along and look impressed. Oh and we watch Colbert&amp;rsquo;s monolog after dins regularly, so we get some real-hard-left news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the news daily was a huge waste, for me personally. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if anyone else wants to read the news, it&amp;rsquo;s a free country. But it was like Faishbook, once I stopped using it I really didn&amp;rsquo;t miss anything there. I&amp;rsquo;m not even an anti-media nutjob, there&amp;rsquo;s just about 95% of things that happen every day will not affect me. So why expend the intellectual energy to learn about them or whatever emotional or psychological energy to empathize or what-have-you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what has happened since I quit reading the news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The climate continues to go to shit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American law/politics continues to be &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vladdy Putin is doing some real awful stuff, poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnny Depp and some lady are in court and it&amp;rsquo;s stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There. You&amp;rsquo;re up-to-date. Call me cynical, you&amp;rsquo;re probably not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-summer&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s summer!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the whole purpose of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers were supposed to make life better and they incredibly, totally have. However, they weren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to simultaneously turn us into mindless numbnutses who argue about everything and have really strong opinions about whatever the topic-du-jour is. They were supposed to provide us with more leisure time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s ride some bikes, hike some trails, pet some dogs, eat some veggie burgers. Plant some trees, eat some veggies and hummus and ride some more bikes. And then let&amp;rsquo;s hang out and talk about it without worrying about pictures to show off how good things are. Let&amp;rsquo;s just enjoy things as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Initial Commit</title>
      <link>https://sadspiders.ca/initial-commit/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;hey-world-look-at-me&#34;&gt;Hey world, look at me!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to start a lot of coding projects and fail to finish them. Myself and quite the army, I would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re first learning to use version control software, you generally save the first version like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#ebdbb2;background-color:#282828;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ git commit -m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#b8bb26&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;initial commit&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;which means you&amp;rsquo;re shoving all of your code into the world and now there&amp;rsquo;s one more project out there that you&amp;rsquo;re never going to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;thinking man&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;thinking man&lt;/strong&gt;, I like to make sure I solve my problems as efficiently as possible. My current project is already finished. Yes, simply by pushing out my initial commit, having it build successfully into the form you are currently reading,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I DID IT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sad spiders is done. This is it. This is all it&amp;rsquo;s ever going to be, until the end of time or until nuclear war or alien attack or rapture, amen. And don&amp;rsquo;t fool yourselves, when the good lord decides to Rapture this place, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be among the chosen. But simply by starting a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; project, configuring a nice, simple theme (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janraasch/&#34;&gt;janraasch&lt;/a&gt; for the sweet theme!) and writing a single, stupid blog post, I am crossing this bastard off my list. It&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-be-mean&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be mean&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good, your writing is dogshit&amp;rdquo; I hear you saying from within my own thoughts. Well, you can&amp;rsquo;t get any better at doing something without practice, right? &lt;em&gt;NO YOU CAN&amp;rsquo;T&lt;/em&gt; except exceptions like watching television or laying down. And what better way to write than to have a platform with very low consequences? I wanted somewhere where I could just &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; and it can be meaningless and &lt;del&gt;stupid&lt;/del&gt; fun but sometimes my brain just needs this outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s call it good there. Honestly having just a blank page in front of you is the worst. More gobbledygook coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
