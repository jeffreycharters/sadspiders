      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-orange-wifi-y-icon&#34;&gt;That orange wifi-y icon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed RSS feeds out in the wilds of the internet? You know, this thing: &lt;img src=&#34;super-rss.png&#34; alt=&#34;rss icon&#34;&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen it everywhere. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t before, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you will now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this isn&amp;rsquo;t just something for nerds to click on. You&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that, because if you ever click on the link to view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadspiders.ca/index.xml&#34;&gt;actual RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, you will indeed be confronted with a wall of technical mumbo-jumbo. But the thing is, that link isn&amp;rsquo;t actually meant for people to look at. It&amp;rsquo;s the site&amp;rsquo;s recent history (like latest articles or whatever) in &lt;em&gt;machine-readable form&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youre-losing-me&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re losing me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeez, are our attention spans really that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can use these feeds for is to create a &lt;strong&gt;curated list of feeds&lt;/strong&gt; that will provide updates from all of your favourite sites &lt;strong&gt;all in one place&lt;/strong&gt;. I shit you not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is get yourself a feed-reader. As you might expect, there are a number of them available for free or with some sort of payment for more features. The most popular out there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34;&gt;feedly&lt;/a&gt; but I have grown attached to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inoreader.com/&#34;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt; for reasons I can no longer remember. Probably simpler and with a prettier UI (user interface), for which I am a sucker. Both of those are available on whatever app store you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sounds-hard&#34;&gt;Sounds hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously. There is a bit of set-up involved, but at least Inoreader has a search where you can type in the name of your favourite site and it will find the RSS link and allow you to add it to your own feed. So now instead of having to go to site X and then site Y and then site R and then back to see if site X has anything new, &lt;em&gt;this shit will all be delivered right to you as soon as it is available&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt;. So now you can get that sort of thing out of the way and spend more time spacing out watching your TikTalks or TedToks or I don&amp;rsquo;t know, does anyone use Snapchat anymore? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t that huge like, a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-in-it-for-sad-spiders&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for sad spiders?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twofold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, it allows my articles to get shoved into your face. We&amp;rsquo;ll be honest and say that you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to visit this site daily looking for new content because we all know it won&amp;rsquo;t be there. With RSS feeds, little guys like myself are able to be seen side-by-side with the big players out there with very little effort. Especially when using the website builder that I use, which pretty much automates the whole process for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two, the feeds will often show you the meat and potato(e)s of a story/article without you needing to wade through all the extra crap they like to scatter about. (Related: use an adblocker! If you really like a site, &lt;em&gt;subscribe&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;donate&lt;/em&gt; to them, it&amp;rsquo;s way better than an ad-based economy). And by cutting out some algorithms that try to tell you what you will like and just seeing everything chronologically, you re-gain a bit of control over how content is presented to you. Power to the people, rah rah. If the story isn&amp;rsquo;t showing up properly for some reason, you just tap on the page and you&amp;rsquo;re whisked off to the actual site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you know and you can&amp;rsquo;t un-know. Give it a try. If you hates it, nothing lost. If you loves it, hey, maybe I have one more dedicated reader? And I think the articles should get more funner now that some of the technical stuff is out of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[End Communication]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I need to work on my definition of idiot</title>
      <link>https://sadspiders.ca/i-need-to-work-on-my-definition-of-idiot/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-a-blog-is-super-easy-right&#34;&gt;Starting a blog is super-easy. Right?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original thought was to sit down and write an article on &amp;ldquo;how any idiot can start a blog using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Hugo is a &lt;em&gt;static site generator&lt;/em&gt;, which means that I create all my blog posts and Hugo mushes them into a usable website like you are using right now. There is minimal interactivity and no database so I thought the whole thing should be pretty for anyone to jump into and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other perk that drew me into Hugo was the these posts are all written using a format called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markdownguide.org&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. A file written in markdown is just a normal boring text file that uses various combinations of characters for formatting. The thought is that these files can be read in plaintext format (like if you opened it in Notepad) or if you opened it in a dedicated markdown editor, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://typora.io&#34;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt; or some online eitor. [Aside: I actually spent real money on Typora. It&amp;rsquo;s like if Word was stripped down to the functions you actually use.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as an example, here&amp;rsquo;s what a snippet of markdown might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This is the title of the page
## And this is a second-level header

I am some text! I can be *italic* or **bold**! You can also include [links to Blurt](https://letsblusrt.duckdns.org).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bad, hey? Even without much knowledge of markdown, you can hopefully get a sense of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-whats-the-problem&#34;&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that at some point along the way I went full-nerd and forgot what a normal computer user is like. I sit here typing this into &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com&#34;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt; my desktop computer where I can easily access my Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) or have two Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s in the basement that I can SSH into for whatever reasons. Before your eyes glaze over and you leave this site never to return, that stuff wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to make sense to you &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was going to write that &amp;ldquo;any idiot could do it&amp;rdquo;, what I meant was &amp;ldquo;any idiot with a decent amount of experience using a command-line and who is happy to websearch the inevitable problem points can do it&amp;rdquo; and holy crap are those two statements ever not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping I could write out some quick instructions here so that maybe a couple of friends might start some blogs and we can be part of an online blog-gang and rove around intimidating other blog-gangs or blog-citizens and experimenting with Cryptocurrencies/Web3 (the smoking of the internet). So what I will do instead, is break things down into two groups. The first being a quick version of what I&amp;rsquo;m using so the bigger nerds out there have a starting point. The second will be for normies who just want to start writing without getting bogged down in frustration before giving up and using Facebook as their soapbox of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sup-nerds-normies-can-skip-to-the-next-section&#34;&gt;Sup, nerds? (normies can skip to the next section)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned multiple times like it was Crossfit or something, I am using Hugo to generate the site. The pros of using Hugo are the superfast build speeds and quick hot-reloads via websockets which allow for a quick and pretty great development experience. It&amp;rsquo;s also a single binary without dependencies so it should be a lot easier to maintain in the long run. The templating language could apparently use some work but I don&amp;rsquo;t have many downsides since I am using it for the simplest possible site. And that&amp;rsquo;s it, my database is folders of markdown files and my front-end is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog&#34;&gt;Bearblog theme&lt;/a&gt; with a few tweaks to improve a11y. It&amp;rsquo;s great for this purpose, I even plan to use minimal images which is strange for me because I love images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everything was in place, I pushed the code to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeffreycharters/sadspiders&#34;&gt;public Github repository&lt;/a&gt; since I don&amp;rsquo;t give two shits about security because what are people going to do, hack and leak my publically available blog posts? Have fun with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To publish the site I signed up for an account on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, said &amp;ldquo;use the repo at this address&amp;rdquo; and they said &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and like two minutes later I was live! They use webhooks or something so that every time I push new updates to Github, the new site is built within a couple of minutes and we&amp;rsquo;re off to the races! It&amp;rsquo;s pretty great since the whole point of &lt;strong&gt;sad spiders&lt;/strong&gt; was &amp;ldquo;simple as possible for minimal excuses&amp;rdquo;. I recommend this pipeline, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sup-other-nerds-yes-this-is-you-normie&#34;&gt;Sup, other nerds? (yes, this is you, normie)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I say &amp;ldquo;normie&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to be mean like I normally do. Just that you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like plodding through a whole ton of crap just to start a really basic blog, and I applaud you for your mature, informed decision. So what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered sending out a few links to various blogging platforms but I decided I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that. I want to send you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev&#34;&gt;Bear Blog&lt;/a&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s as barebones as &lt;strong&gt;sad spiders&lt;/strong&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s what I want from people. Content, not &lt;em&gt;zazz&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;zazz&lt;/em&gt;, but not always &lt;em&gt;zazz&lt;/em&gt;. So get yourself on over there and sign up and let me know so I can add you to my as-yet-uncreated Friends page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;up-and-at-them&#34;&gt;Up and at them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting real sick of the normal internet. The articles are all interesting but after reading them I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any better. I would way rather read some BS that people I &lt;em&gt;actually know&lt;/em&gt; have written rather than some carefully crafted nonsense. It&amp;rsquo;s the same way I&amp;rsquo;d rather watch &lt;em&gt;Father Ted&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in media, the message is the message. Marshall McLuhan, you idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
