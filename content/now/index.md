### What am I up to, now?

Well, as of Mid-September, 2025.

Have been training to bike faster since December of last year. Have only done one real event this year, but recently rode a 100km loop on predominantly dirt roads and rail trails in a new record time. Have a number of races/events on the docket for next year, including:

- **Paris to Ancaster (P2A)** 70km
- **Screamin' Squirrel** 70 km 
- **100 Acre Gravel** 100 km
- **Hurtin' in Haliburton** 8 hour solo

This season is coming to a close and I am pondering entering a cyclocross (cx) race just to see what it is like. My commuter bike happily moonlights as a cx bike, so I could hopefully just swap out some tires and have a go. We'll see. Maybe.

Have been enjoying writing code in Go lately. I code mostly for fun, occasionally to make something at work easier. Automate the boring stuff.

Currently reading Norman Mailer's *The Naked and the Dead*. It's alright, I don't entirely love it but it offers a bit of a view into the minds of soldiers during WWII.

Been listening to a lot of Post-rock lately, as usual. Artists like Parker and Ephilexia. While on the trainer, still lots of Rise Against and Much the Same - upbeat melodic punk. Ugh, punk. Seems so aged now.

Really enjoying self-hosting a lot of my own services. More in a blog post maybe.
