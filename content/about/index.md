## About the spiders

The sad spiders blog-writing syndicate consists entirely of this one dude named Jeffrey who hails from Ontario, Canada.

Jeffrey is a man of many interests. He enjoys saying curse words, enjoying Christmas-day beers and reading books on his beloved Kobo eReader. He definitely doesn't condone pirating movies and/or television shows.

Evenings and weekends you'll find him out riding one of his bicycles, two of whom are named after beloved Simpsons characters. (TODO: Write a little blog about Grimey and Scorpio). One time he rode Grimey 161+ km in a day. This sounds arbitrary but there's this archaic unit of measurement called a "mile" which is bigger than a km to the tune of 1.6:1. So that means he rode 100 miles, also known as a "century" and apparently that's a thing. There's a [blog post about this](../my-first-century), since it was pretty awful and he hated most seconds of it.

For work Jeffrey is the technical supervisor of a veterinary toxicology lab. Sometimes not for work he writes code in Typescript and Go and other programming languages can go to hell. He likes Sveltekit for websites. He briefly worked as a web developer until he realized that the web generally fucking sucks except also he wasn't fired he was laid off, but you wouldn't know the difference.

~~Feel free to get involved with him on Mastodon!~~ He has no web presence where he can help it.
