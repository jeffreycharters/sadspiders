## Hello. I'm Jeffrey.

To stare into the sun without regard for the consequences is the ultimate freedom.

They can take your house, they can take your clothes, but they can never take away your ability to stare into the sun for minutes at a time.

I guess actually they could do that pretty easily, nevermind.

We're **boned**.
