## Projects

<!-- TODO: add zazz -->

Here's a few things I work on when I have the motivation.

- [LabVantage Prettifier](https://github.com/jeffreycharters/LabvantageUX): Make LabVantage less bad
- [Blurt](https://blurt.sadspiders.ca): a popular microtweeting platform.
- Some work-specific shit you can't see.
- ~~Radriders (offline): a very *un*sexy bike blog.~~
